## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * @fileoverview This file only declares the public portions of the API.
 * It should not define internal pieces such as utils or modifier details.

/**
 * This kind of namespace declaration is not necessary, but is kept here for backwards-compatibility with
 * popper.js 1.x. It can be removed in 2.x so that the default export is simply the Popper class
 * and all the types / interfaces are top-level named exports.
