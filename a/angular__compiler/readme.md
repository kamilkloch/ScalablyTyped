/**
 * A path is an ordered set of elements. Typically a path is to  a
 * particular offset in a source file. The head of the list is the top
 * most node. The tail is the node that contains the offset directly.
 *
 * For example, the expression `a + b + c` might have an ast that looks
 * like:
 *     +
 *    / \
 *   a   +
 *      / \
 *     b   c
 *
 * The path to the node at offset 9 would be `['+' at 1-10, '+' at 7-10,
 * 'c' at 9-10]` and the path the node at offset 1 would be
 * `['+' at 1-10, 'a' at 1-2]`.
