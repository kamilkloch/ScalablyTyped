/**
 * When ranges are returned, the array has a "type" property which is the type of
 * range that is required (most commonly, "bytes"). Each array element is an object
 * with a "start" and "end" property for the portion of the range.
 *
 * @returns `-1` when unsatisfiable and `-2` when syntactically invalid, ranges otherwise.
