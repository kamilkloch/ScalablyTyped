// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 3.0
// Known Issue:
// There is a known issue in TypeScript, which doesn't allow decorators to change the signature of the classes
// they are decorating. Due to this, if you are using @connect() decorator in your code,
// you will see a bunch of errors from TypeScript. The current workaround is to use connect() as a function call on
// a separate line instead of as a decorator. Discussed in this github issue:
// https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/20796
// NOTE about the wrong react-redux version in the header comment:
// The actual react-redux version is not 6.0.0, but we had to increase the major version
// to update this type definitions for redux@4.x from redux@3.x.
