/**
 * Zone is a mechanism for intercepting and keeping track of asynchronous work.
 *
 * A Zone is a global object which is configured with rules about how to intercept and keep track
 * of the asynchronous callbacks. Zone has these responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Intercept asynchronous task scheduling
 * 2. Wrap callbacks for error-handling and zone tracking across async operations.
 * 3. Provide a way to attach data to zones
 * 4. Provide a context specific last frame error handling
 * 5. (Intercept blocking methods)
 *
 * A zone by itself does not do anything, instead it relies on some other code to route existing
 * platform API through it. (The zone library ships with code which monkey patches all of the
 * browsers's asynchronous API and redirects them through the zone for interception.)
 *
 * In its simplest form a zone allows one to intercept the scheduling and calling of asynchronous
 * operations, and execute additional code before as well as after the asynchronous task. The rules
 * of interception are configured using [ZoneConfig]. There can be many different zone instances in
 * a system, but only one zone is active at any given time which can be retrieved using
 * [Zone#current].
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Callback Wrapping
 *
 * An important aspect of the zones is that they should persist across asynchronous operations. To
 * achieve this, when a future work is scheduled through async API, it is necessary to capture, and
 * subsequently restore the current zone. For example if a code is running in zone `b` and it
 * invokes `setTimeout` to scheduleTask work later, the `setTimeout` method needs to 1) capture the
 * current zone and 2) wrap the `wrapCallback` in code which will restore the current zone `b` once
 * the wrapCallback executes. In this way the rules which govern the current code are preserved in
 * all future asynchronous tasks. There could be a different zone `c` which has different rules and
 * is associated with different asynchronous tasks. As these tasks are processed, each asynchronous
 * wrapCallback correctly restores the correct zone, as well as preserves the zone for future
 * asynchronous callbacks.
 *
 * Example: Suppose a browser page consist of application code as well as third-party
 * advertisement code. (These two code bases are independent, developed by different mutually
 * unaware developers.) The application code may be interested in doing global error handling and
 * so it configures the `app` zone to send all of the errors to the server for analysis, and then
 * executes the application in the `app` zone. The advertising code is interested in the same
 * error processing but it needs to send the errors to a different third-party. So it creates the
 * `ads` zone with a different error handler. Now both advertising as well as application code
 * create many asynchronous operations, but the [Zone] will ensure that all of the asynchronous
 * operations created from the application code will execute in `app` zone with its error
 * handler and all of the advertisement code will execute in the `ads` zone with its error handler.
 * This will not only work for the async operations created directly, but also for all subsequent
 * asynchronous operations.
 *
 * If you think of chain of asynchronous operations as a thread of execution (bit of a stretch)
 * then [Zone#current] will act as a thread local variable.
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Asynchronous operation scheduling
 *
 * In addition to wrapping the callbacks to restore the zone, all operations which cause a
 * scheduling of work for later are routed through the current zone which is allowed to intercept
 * them by adding work before or after the wrapCallback as well as using different means of
 * achieving the request. (Useful for unit testing, or tracking of requests). In some instances
 * such as `setTimeout` the wrapping of the wrapCallback and scheduling is done in the same
 * wrapCallback, but there are other examples such as `Promises` where the `then` wrapCallback is
 * wrapped, but the execution of `then` is triggered by `Promise` scheduling `resolve` work.
 *
 * Fundamentally there are three kinds of tasks which can be scheduled:
 *
 * 1. [MicroTask] used for doing work right after the current task. This is non-cancelable which is
 *    guaranteed to run exactly once and immediately.
 * 2. [MacroTask] used for doing work later. Such as `setTimeout`. This is typically cancelable
 *    which is guaranteed to execute at least once after some well understood delay.
 * 3. [EventTask] used for listening on some future event. This may execute zero or more times, with
 *    an unknown delay.
 *
 * Each asynchronous API is modeled and routed through one of these APIs.
 *
 *
 * ### [MicroTask]
 *
 * [MicroTask]s represent work which will be done in current VM turn as soon as possible, before VM
 * yielding.
 *
 *
 * ### [MacroTask]
 *
 * [MacroTask]s represent work which will be done after some delay. (Sometimes the delay is
 * approximate such as on next available animation frame). Typically these methods include:
 * `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, and all browser specific
 * variants.
 *
 *
 * ### [EventTask]
 *
 * [EventTask]s represent a request to create a listener on an event. Unlike the other task
 * events they may never be executed, but typically execute more than once. There is no queue of
 * events, rather their callbacks are unpredictable both in order and time.
 *
 *
 * ## Global Error Handling
 *
 *
 * ## Composability
 *
 * Zones can be composed together through [Zone.fork()]. A child zone may create its own set of
 * rules. A child zone is expected to either:
 *
 * 1. Delegate the interception to a parent zone, and optionally add before and after wrapCallback
 *    hooks.
 * 2. Process the request itself without delegation.
 *
 * Composability allows zones to keep their concerns clean. For example a top most zone may choose
 * to handle error handling, while child zones may choose to do user action tracking.
 *
 *
 * ## Root Zone
 *
 * At the start the browser will run in a special root zone, which is configured to behave exactly
 * like the platform, making any existing code which is not zone-aware behave as expected. All
 * zones are children of the root zone.
