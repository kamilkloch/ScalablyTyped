/**
 * Returns the current time as defined by performance.now if available, and Date.now if not.
 * The current time is updated at the start of a frame; it is thus consistent during the frame, and any timers scheduled during the same frame will be synchronized.
 * If this method is called outside of a frame, such as in response to a user event, the current time is calculated and then fixed until the next frame,
 * again ensuring consistent timing during event handling.
